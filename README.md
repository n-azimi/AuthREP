# AuthREP: Unsuccessful Login Attempts Report Script

This bash script generates a report on unsuccessful login attempts. It filters entries related to authentication failures and allows the user to choose the output format (either `.txt` or `.csv`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- The script assumes that the system is running a Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS).
- You must have access to the `/var/log/auth.log` file or equivalent log file for authentication failures.
- The script requires basic command-line utilities like `awk`, `grep`, `sed`, and `sort`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. Clone the script and navigate to the directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n-azimi/AuthREP.git && cd AuthREP
   ```

2. Make sure the script is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod u+x script.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

4. The script will display a summary of the unsuccessful login attempts from the `auth.log` file. It will include the following columns:
   - Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
   - Login Name
   - Login Terminal
   - Login User
   - Remote User
   - Remote Host

5. You will then be prompted to choose the output format. You can choose between `txt` or `csv` format.

6. Once you select a format, the data will be saved to the current directory.
